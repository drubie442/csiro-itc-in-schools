	  Basic JavaScript programming 3</h1>
  <p>
  You can define functions in JavaScript.  A function is a section of code which can be called from another part of your code.  Functions are useful for encapsulating code that you want to call repeatedly without copying and pasting it everywhere.  In the sample script.js there are two functions defined but neither are called when the page is loaded.  Instead, we are using HTML to call the functions when a button on the page is pressed.
  </p>
  <p>
  Also in this script you can see quite a few new concepts - we are using the &quot;DOM&quot; to find a particular thing on our page (in this case, a drawable object called a canvas).  Objects in JavaScript encapsulate behaviour - you can ask an object about itself or ask it to do something.  In our case, we are asking it to clear or draw squares (really, rectangles, but squares are the easy case).
  </p>
  <h2>Exercises</h2>
  <ol><li>Change the width of the border on the canvas (hint: style.css)</li>
  <li>Change the name of the function which clears the square and ensure it still works (hint: example3.html)</li>
	  <li>Change the step size of the squares being drawn and change the drawing to a rectangle.  Add a new variable for the width of the rectangle to do this.</li>
	  <li>Use the debugger to step through your program</li>
  </ol>
